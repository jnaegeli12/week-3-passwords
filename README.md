# Week 3 Homework Assignment: Random Password Generator
This is an application for a password generator that creates a password based on user input. On the click of the button in the browser, the user is first prompted to enter the number of desired characters. The password will only return between 8 and 128 characters, so if the user enters a number less than 8 or more than 128, they will receive an alert asking the user to start over. After entering an appropriate number, the user will be asked whether they want certain characters included: numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters.

The code uses while loops for the input sequences, the array.push() method with the spread operator to merge the chosen sets of characters into a single array, and final for loop with the math.random function to output a random set of characters for a password.
